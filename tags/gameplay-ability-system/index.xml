When abilities fail to activate, cooldowns exhibit unexpected behavior, or effect stacks accumulate incorrectly, diagnosing issues through logs alone proves inefficient and time-intensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, GAS includes built-in debug commands that reveal real-time data about abilities, active effects, tags, and attributes—making it easier to pinpoint and fix problems fast.
This post highlights five essential commands for profiling and troubleshooting GAS, helping you streamline debugging whether you’re working on combat systems, character progression, or multiplayer replication.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
